# Assessing clean-up volumes for Tongatapu following the 2022 HTHH eruption
Python code to estimate the volume of volcanic ash that may need to removal. The model is based upon the model presented in [Hayes et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13617-016-0052-3) and [Hayes et al. (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13617-019-0087-3). The code here accompanies a forthcoming paper.
